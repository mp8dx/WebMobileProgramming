                    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a 
                    field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each 
                    end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 
                    The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat 
                    (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to 
                    prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to 
                    either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal 
                    include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by 
                    the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it 
                    hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the 
                    crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings 
                    ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a 
                    third umpire and match referee in international matches.

                    Cricket is one of many games in the "club ball" sphere that basically involve hitting
                     a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many 
                     similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games 
                     category[2]), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis. In cricket's
                      case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket 
                      (originally, it is thought, a "wicket gate" through which sheep were herded), that 
                      the batsman must defend. The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three 
                      "groups" of "club ball" games: the "hockey group", in which the ball is driven to 
                      and fro between two targets (the goals); the "golf group", in which the ball is 
                      driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the "cricket group", in which 
                      "the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it".

                    It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the 
                    south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period. 
                    Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being 
                    played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 
                    (Old Style), equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar. 
                    The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the 
                    testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that: 
                    Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows 
                    did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.
